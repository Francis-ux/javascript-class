Examples of arithmetic operators are:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Modulus: %
Increment: ++
Decrement: --

2. Assignment

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
Examples of assignment operators are:

Equality: =
Addition assignment: +=
Subtraction assignment: -=
Multiplication assignment: *=
Division assignment: /=
Modulus assignment: %=
Increment assignment: +=
Decrement assignment: -=

3. Comparison

Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
Examples of comparison operators are:

Equal to: ==
Not equal to: !=
Greater than: >
Less than: <
Greater than or equal to: >=
Less than or equal to: <=
Logical AND: &&
